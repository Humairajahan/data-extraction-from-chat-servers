# Extract data from discord channel

Unlike `telegram`, where further processing was required after data extraction, `discord` unfortunately does not offer any in-built methods towards this end.

There are multiple other ways of achieving this objective such as:

- [X] Third party softwares and tools (DiscordChatExporter)
- [ ] YAGPDB (Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot)
- [ ] MEE6
- [X] Chrome extensions
